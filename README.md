# Peek In Pi Text Decoding
This is a javaFx program that finds hidden text messages in Pi.
A file full of the first million digits of pi is given in the program files.

At the moment, there is a basic UI to allow for converting from numbers to text, using % 26 modulo conversion.

As well as a search tool that lets you input text to see if it appears in the digits of Pi that are searched.

The program also outputs a file of the converted text just incase you want to use that for something.
